# Rubric
## Technical Requirements
Performing. The app has at least 2 model CRUD functionality. I would encourage you to actually leverage your user authentication. As it stands right now, you can associate a trip with a profile. But any person, not even logged in, can just edit the trip. I would also revamp the domain model such that signups contain information specific to that persons trip, rather than a blanket trip for anyone that registers with it.

## Creativity/Interface
Performing. The app looks very clean, and I can see the direction you're trying to move in. I think you would benefit considerably refocusing your domain model; moving some properties around and highlighting more aspects of your user authentication.

## Code Quality
Performing. There are some indentation issues. I would also encourage you to make comments throughout your code.

## Functionality
Performing. The app's crud functionality is definitely working correctly. I would, however, think about some features of the app. IE. not allowing for CRUD without certain authoirizations.
